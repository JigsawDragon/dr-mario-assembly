# dr-mario-assembly

This is an adaptation of the Dr.Mario game made on a 32x32 grid of an Assembly project using MIPS ruleset. Although this project was part of the curriculum for a circuits and assembly course, students were not given a template to work with so all of this has been done from scratch. In the span of 2 weeks I created a functioning logic dr mario game with physics, stack logic, and a full understanding of registers in a memory's processor. 

I used the Saturn IDE, which was the recommended IDE due to its adaptable nature and the fact that it is newer compared to its ancient alternative, MARS. This IDE has been created by a student soon to graduate and it is a fantastic and comfortable IDE for assembly coding. If you'd like to run this code you can download either of the 2 above IDEs and open the .asm file on it.
